BigNumbers
==========

A collection of PHP source programs that performs calculations with numbers of
arbitrary size, suitable to be used with currency calculations and other
non-intensive tasks that require absolute precision.

BigInt.php

	Provides the BigInt class that deals with integer numbers of arbitrary
	length.

BigFloat.php

	Provides the BigFloat class that deals with floating-point numbers of
	arbitrary precision. Requires BigInt.php.

ExprEval.php
	
	Provides the class ExprEval that evaluates simple algebraic expressions
	passed as string of characters, returning back the result as BigFloat
	number. Requires BigInt.php and BigFloat.php.

test*.php

	Testing programs, executed by "make test".

*.success

	The presence of this file means the test on the corresponding module
	successfully passed the test program.

Installation
------------
Simply copy the *.php source file in its destination directory. Remember that
BigFloat depends on BigInt, so if you need the former you will need also the
latter. To save space and for better performances, you may want to strip the
source, for example

	$ php -w BigInt.php > dest/dir/BigInt.php

Documentation
-------------
Every source includes its own documentation that can be extracted with the
PHPLint validator and documentator program (www.icosaedro.it/phplint). The same
documents are available also at www.icosaedro.it/bignumbers .

Updates
-------
The package is available as stable release at www.icosaedro.it/bignumbers .
You can also have a look at http://cvs.icosaedro.it for possible last-minute
updates.
