		must belong to this new class. To summarize, the recommended

		if( get_class($other) !== __CLASS__ )

		$other2 = cast(__CLASS__, $other);
		...here, comparison specific of this class...
		return result_of_the_comparison;
	}
	</pre>
		@param object $other The other object.
		@return int Negative, zero or positive if $this is less, equal or
		greater than $other respectively.
		@throws CastException If the other object belongs to a different
		class and cannot be compared with this.
