/**
	Class autoloading package. This package provides the magic __autoload()
	function for class autoloading, and also makes aware PHPLint that class
	autoloading is enabled and how to fetch the required classes. The PHPLint
	reference manual explains in more details how the class autoloading
	mechanism works and when class autoloading is triggered by PHPLint and by
	PHP.

	This file should be located in the base directory of the libraries tree. In
	turn, every library should then import this package using something like:
	<pre>require_once __DIR__ . "/../../../autoload.php";</pre> Note that we
	<b>must</b> use the special constant __DIR__ because at runtime the current
	working directory is set by the client package (that is, the original PHP
	program that was started first) and might not be the directory of the
	library itself.

	Another feature of this package is that it verify that the correct
	PHP configuration file be loaded. The php.ini file MUST be located
	in the same directory of this package. If not found there, the
	program exits with die().
